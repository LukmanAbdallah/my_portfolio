# my_portfolio

DevOps Engineer specializing in the design, automation, and management of scalable, secure, and highly available cloud infrastructure with strong CI/CD practices.

I am a results-driven DevOps Engineer with strong hands-on experience across the complete DevOps lifecycle, from development and version control to continuous integration, automated testing, deployment, monitoring, and optimization. I have a deep understanding of DevOps principles and processes, and I work comfortably across both development and operations environments.

My skill set includes building and maintaining CI/CD pipelines, managing cloud platforms, containerization and orchestration, infrastructure as code, configuration management, system monitoring, and automation. I am passionate about improving deployment efficiency, system reliability, and collaboration between engineering teams through modern DevOps practices.

This repository showcases my projects, experiments, and practical implementations that reflect real-world DevOps workflows, best practices, and problem-solving approaches. I am continuously learning new technologies and refining my skills to deliver scalable, resilient, and high-performing systems.

I am open to opportunities where I can contribute my expertise, grow professionally, and add measurable value as a DevOps Engineer.
